# üìñ Hello Rails Backend
**Hello Rails Backend** is a basic Rails API that has an endpoint that returns a random greeting from a previously set-up database table in JSON format. You can find the front end built with React [here](https://github.com/crclothier/hello-react-front-end).  This has been made as an exercise for Microverse Bootcamp.
